Purpose of the Program

Desc: create a program which performs three essential operations.
      It will process this .txt file: Gettysburg.txt.
      Calculate the total words, and output the number of occurrences of each word in the file.

Usage: Open the file and process each line.
       Either add each word to the dictionary with a frequency of 1 or update the wordâ€™s count by 1.
       Nicely print the output, in this case from high to low frequency.

       add_word: Add each word to the dictionary. Parameters are the word and a dictionary. No return value.

       Process_line: There is some work to be done to process the line: strip off various characters,
       split out the words, and so on. Parameters are a line and the dictionary.
       It calls the function add word with each processed word. No return value.

       Pretty_print: Because formatted printing can be messy and often particular to each situation
       (meaning that we might need to modify it later), we separated out the printing function.
       The parameter is a dictionary. No return value.

       main: We will use a main function as the main program. As usual, it will open the file
       and call process_line on each line. When finished, it will call pretty_print to print the dictionary.
       In the main function, you will need to open the file.
